Good analysis requires good data, but how can how can a high-quality 
AIRR dataset be distinguished from a low-quality one? Rep-Cred fills this need 
by identifying and reporting several key metrics that can be 
indicators of potential problems. Modeled after fastqc, Rep-Cred provides an
easily digestible summary that can be used by novices and experts alike.

The only requirement to run Rep-Cred is a file describing IG and/or TCR 
rearrangements in the [AIRR TSV format](https://docs.airr-community.org/en/stable/datarep/rearrangements.html). 
You can find a small <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airr-community/rep-cred/master/inst/extdata/ExampleDb.tsv" target="_blank">example repertoire here</a>.


By default, all repertoires are randomly down-sampled to 5000 rearrangements; 
we find that this still provides an accurate assessment of repertoire 
credibility while maintaining a reasonable run time.

Finally, if a custom 
(non-IMGT?) database was used to annotate the rearrangements, this should be 
provided to Rep-Cred as well, so that SHM and related statistics can be 
calculated accurately.

To get help or report a bug, please file an issue on Rep-Credâ€™s github 
page at [https://github.com/airr-community/rep-cred/issues](https://github.com/airr-community/rep-cred/issues).

Rep-Cred is designed to be modular and accept new functions/metrics with ease. We welcome pull requests 
(please see [https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst](https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)). Other feature requests will be evaluated and prioritized.
